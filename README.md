This project provides a library for accessing the most common services of the Metasys Server API.
The intent is to provide an API that is very similar to the original MSSDA
(Metasys System Secure Data Access) library.

For versioning information see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A method of installing NuGet packages as described by the Microsoft
[Package Consumpion Workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/overview-and-workflow).

### .NET

To use in a .NET application include the following in the target source files:

```csharp
using JohnsonControls.Metasys.BasicServices;
```

Option 1: Consume the package by adding a PackageReference.

1. Add the following to the project's .csproj file:

    ```csharp
    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="JohnsonControls.Metasys.BasicServices" Version="<target version>" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

Option 2: Consume the package by installing on the command line.
This workflow shows how to use the nuget.exe CLI (command line interface).

1. Open a command line and navigate to your project's main directory.
2. Execute the following command:

    ```cli
    nuget install JohnsonControls.Metasys.BasicServices -OutputDirectory packages
    ```

3. Update all packages with the command:

    ```cli
    nuget restore
    ```

### COM (Component Object Model)

Use the one click setup provided with the release tag to install the required dependencies in your system and register the COM DLL.
Keep in mind that for developing purposes the solution is already configured to register with the COM interop when the project is built. Alternatively, you can manually register or unregister the DLL use the RegCOM.bat and UnregCOM.bat scripts located in the Scripts directory.

To manually register for COM interop you can also use the Regasm.exe (Assembly Registration Tool) or similar tool.
[See more information here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/regasm-exe-assembly-registration-tool).

### Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)

LegacyMetasysClient allows you to interact with your Metasys server from a VBA application using COM interop.
To get start, enable the Developer Tab in Excel from the menu File-->Options-->Customize Ribbon.
[See more information here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45).
Finally, from the Developer Tab click the Visual Basic button to open the editor and add the reference to the Metasys Services Object Library from the references list.
[See more information here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/how-to/check-or-add-an-object-library-reference).

## Usage (.NET)

This section demonstrates how to use the MetasysClient to interact with your Metasys server from a .NET application.
There is an example on [Github](https://github.com/metasys-server/basic-services-dotnet/tree/master/MetasysServicesExampleApp) that can be run from the command line and a specific prototype of an API to API integration about a  [Weather Forecast application](https://github.com/metasys-server/basic-services-dotnet/tree/master/WeatherForecastApp).

### Creating a Client

To create a new client and connect to a Metasys server with the default settings use:

```csharp
var client = new MetasysClient("hostname");
```

There are four optional parameters when creating a new client:

- ignoreCertificateErrors: If your server does not have a valid certificate the MetasysClient will not behave as expected and will likely block the connection. Setting the ignoreCertificateErrors = true will ignore this error and make an insecure connection with the server. To avoid this problem ensure the Metasys server has a valid certificate.  
  
  **WARNING: You should not ignore certificate errors on a production site. Doing so puts your server at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack.**  

- apiVersion: if your server is not a current 10.1 Metasys server or later this SDK will not function correctly. The version parameter takes in an ApiVersion enumeration value that defaults to the most current release of Metasys. For Metasys 10.1 the api version is v2, for Metasys 11 the api version is v3, for Metasys 12 the api version is v4 and for Metasys 13 the api version is v5.
- cultureInfo: to set the language for localization specify the target culture with a CultureInfo object. The default culture is en-US.
- logClientErrors: set this flag to false to disable logging of client errors. By default the library logs any communication error with the Metasys Server in this path: "C:\ProgramData\Johnson Controls\Metasys Services\Logs".
- timeout: to set the timeout (in seconds) of the https requests. The default timeut value is 300 sec.

  
Example: the following code shows how to create a client that ignores certificate errors for a v12 Metasys server with Italian translations of values:

```csharp
CultureInfo culture = new CultureInfo("it-IT");
var client = new MetasysClient("hostname", true, ApiVersion.v4, culture);
```
In some cases you may want to enrich logs with more specific messages to your application. Typically, you disable internal library logging and catch Metasys Exceptions to be handled in your own logging framework or in use for Log4Net initializer provided by the library. The file log4Net.config allows you to customize settings such as the file path, size, append mode, etc.
To create a client with default settings that does not log errors use:

```csharp
var client = new MetasysClient("hostname", logClientErrors: false);
```

To log your own errors with Log4Net initializer provided by the library use:

```csharp
// Initialize Logger with your context Class
var log = new LogInitializer(typeof(Program));            
try
{
    // Your Try logic here...
}
catch (Exception ex) {
    log.Logger.Error(string.Format("An error occured - {0}", ex.Message));
}
```
See the following examples to change the API version and/or hostname after creating a client, keep in mind that changing one of these properties resets the access token and a new login is required.
```csharp
// Changing Api version after creating a client
var client = new MetasysClient("hostname",version: ApiVersion.v3);
client.Version = ApiVersion.v2;
```

```csharp
// Changing Metasys Server after creating a client
var client = new MetasysClient("hostname");
client.Hostname = "WIN2016-VM2";
```
### Login and Access Tokens

After creating the client, to login use the method **`TryLogin`**.
The signature has two overloads: the first uses the Credential Manager target to read the credentials, whilst the second takes a username and password.
Both signatures take an optional parameter to automatically refresh the access token during the client's lifetime. 
The default token refresh policy is true. See more information [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026814/windows-accessing-credential-manager) on how to use Credential Manager. If something goes wrong while accessing a Credential Manager target, MetasysClient raises a CredManException. Keep in mind that Credential Manager is available on Windows and is not going to work on other platforms. However, MetasysClient Class could be extended by developers to implement different secure vaults support.

**Notice: when developing an application that uses a system account always logged without user input, the preferred way to login is to store the username and password in the Credential Manager vault.**

```csharp
// Automatically refresh token using plain credentials
client.TryLogin("username", "password");

// Do not automatically refresh token using plain credentials
client.TryLogin("username", "password", false);

// Read target from Credential Manager and automatically refresh token
client.TryLogin("metasys-energy-app");

// Read target from Credential Manager and do not refresh token
client.TryLogin("metasys-energy-app", false);

// Sample of a valid access token returne by the previous methods:
/*

    "Issuer": "metasysserver",
    "IssuedTo": "metasysapiuser",

}
*/

```
<br/>

In case you need to get a new access token then use the method **`Refresh`** before the token expiration time.

```csharp
client.Refresh();
```
<br/>

To get the current access token (e.g. to use it in an different HttpClient) use the method **`GetAccessToken`**.

```csharp
client.GetAccesToken()
```
<br/>

To get the current date & time of the server you can use the method **`GetServerTime`**.
```csharp
client.GetServerTime()
```
<br/>


### Localization of Metasys Enumerations
To get automatically translated enumerations from a Metasys server you have to use the method **`Localize`**.  
Note that you must specify the culture during client creation, or set the "Culture" property before using the "get" methods.  
The default language for translations will be the machine's current culture ([see more information here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture)) or en-US (American English) if the language is not supported (see [Supported Localization Languages](#supported-localization-languages)).

```csharp
client.Culture = new CultureInfo("it-IT");
```

Enumerations returned from a Metasys server will be in a format similar to: "reliabilityEnumSet.reliable". 
MetasysClient has a method to translate these enumerations manually. This method can be very useful if using an external HttpClient since Metasys servers do not hold translation information.

```csharp
// Access from the client object
string translated = client.Localize("reliabilityEnumSet.reliable"); // Reliable

// Access without instantiating a client
string translated = ResourceManager.Localize("reliabilityEnumSet.reliable",
    new CultureInfo("it-IT"));  // Affidabile
```

Note: If an automatically translated value (such as Variant.StringValue) contains an enumeration value and not a translated string there could be an error with the MetasysClient globalization setup.

If the enumeration key is desired over the translated value use the EnumerationKey attribute. For example, the translated Variant.Reliability has the enumeration key under the attribute: Variant.ReliabilityEnumerationKey. See the documentation of each Model for more information.
<br/>


### Metasys Objects
<br/>

#### Get Object Id
In order to use most of the methods in MetasysClient the identifier (Id) of the target object must be known.  
This Id is in the form of a Guid and can be requested using the method **`GetObjectIdentifier`** given you know the 'Fully Qualified Reference' (FQR) of the object:

```csharp
Guid objectId = client.GetObjectIdentifier("Win2016-VM2:vNAE2343996/Field Bus MSTP1.VAV-08.ZN-SP");
Console.WriteLine(objectId);
/*        
d5d96cd3-db4a-52e0-affd-8bc3393c30ec
*/
```
<br/>

#### Get a Property
In order to get a property you must know the Guid of the target object and then you can use the method **`ReadProperty`**. 
An object called "Variant" is returned when getting a property from an object. 
Variant contains the property received in many different forms. There is a bit of intuition when handling a Variant since it will not explicitly provide the type of object received by the server. If the server cannot find the target object or attribute on the object this method will throw a MetasysHttpNotFoundException.
```csharp
Variant property = client.ReadProperty(objectId, "presentValue");
Console.WriteLine(property);
/*        
{
    "StringValue": "72",
    "StringValueEnumerationKey": null,
    "NumericValue": 72.0,
    "BooleanValue": true,
    "ArrayValue": null,
    "Attribute": "presentValue",
    "Id": "f1469e25-c46c-5009-b92e-d82603e742a4",
    "Reliability": "Reliable",
    "ReliabilityEnumerationKey": "reliabilityEnumSet.reliable",
    "Priority": "0 (No Priority)",
    "PriorityEnumerationKey": "writePriorityEnumSet.priorityNone",
    "IsReliable": true
}
*/
```

To get multiple properties from multiple objects in one action use the method **`ReadPropertyMultiple`**. 
This can be very useful if the objects all are of the same type or have the same target properties.

```csharp
List<Guid> ids = new List<Guid> { id1, id2 };
List<string> attributes = new List<string> { "name", "description", "presentValue" };
IEnumerable<VariantMultiple> results = client.ReadPropertyMultiple(ids, attributes);
VariantMultiple multiple1 = results.FindById(id1);
Console.WriteLine(multiple1);
/*
{
    "Id": "d5d96cd3-db4a-52e0-affd-8bc3393c30ec",
    "Variants": [
    {
        "StringValue": "ZN-T",
        "StringValueEnumerationKey": "ZN-T",
        "NumericValue": 0.0,
        "BooleanValue": false,
        "ArrayValue": null,
        "Attribute": "name",
        "Id": "d5d96cd3-db4a-52e0-affd-8bc3393c30ec",
        "Reliability": "Reliable",
        "ReliabilityEnumerationKey": "reliabilityEnumSet.reliable",
        "Priority": null,
        "PriorityEnumerationKey": null,
        "IsReliable": true
    },
    {
        "StringValue": "Zone Temperature",
        "StringValueEnumerationKey": "Zone Temperature",
        "NumericValue": 0.0,
        "BooleanValue": false,
        "ArrayValue": null,
        "Attribute": "description",
        "Id": "d5d96cd3-db4a-52e0-affd-8bc3393c30ec",
        "Reliability": "Reliable",
        "ReliabilityEnumerationKey": "reliabilityEnumSet.reliable",
        "Priority": null,
        "PriorityEnumerationKey": null,
        "IsReliable": true
    }
    ]
}
*/
Variant multiple1Description = multiple1.FindAttributeByName("description");
```
<br/>

#### Write a Property
In order to write a property you must have the Guid of the object and know the attribute name and type
and then you have to use the method **`WriteProperty`**.  
```csharp
Guid id = client.GetObjectIdentifier("siteName:naeName/Folder1.AV1");
client.WriteProperty(id, "description", "This is an AV.");
```
<br/>

To change the same attribute values of many objects use the method **`WritePropertyMultiple`**. 
```csharp
List<Guid> ids = new List<Guid> { id1, id2 };
// Write to many attributes values using a list of tuples
List<(string, object)> attributesList = new List<(string, object)> { ("description", "This is an AV.") };
client.WritePropertyMultiple(ids, attributesList);

// Write to many attributes values using a dictionary of attribute/value pairs
Dictionary<string, object> attributesDictionary = new Dictionary<string, object> { { "description", "This is an AV." } };
client.WritePropertyMultiple(ids, attributesDictionary);
```
<br/>

#### Get and Send Commands
To get all available commands on an object use the method **`GetCommands`**. 
This method will return a list of Command objects. 
The ToString() method is a useful tool to display the available commands and any information associated with it.  
When sending a command the Command.CommandId attribute is used as the parameter:
```csharp
List<Command> commands = client.GetCommands(objectId).ToList();
Command command = commands.FindById("Adjust");
Console.WriteLine(command);
/*                        
{
    "Title": "Adjust",
    "TitleEnumerationKey": "commandIdEnumSet.adjustCommand",
    "CommandId": "Adjust",
    "Items": [
    {
        "Title": "Value",
        "Type": "number",

When sending a command there may or may not be a single value or list of values that needs to be sent with the command. 
The property **`Command.Items`** will list all of these values as Items which contains the Title and Type of the value to change. 
If the type of an Item is "oneOf" this indicates the values is an enumeration and the possible values will be contained in the EnumerationValues list. 
Keep in mind the values to be sent in the command is the TitleEnumerationKey not the Title. 
The Title is the user friendly translated value that describes the enumeration. For example, an "AV Mapper" object has the following commands:

- "Adjust" that accepts a number value to adjust the present value.
- "TemporaryOperatorOverride" that accepts the value to adjust the present value, the hours, and the minutes for the temporary adjustment.
- "Release" which accepts two enumeration values for the attribute and new priority level.

The values on the Commands will model the following:

```csharp
Command adjust = commands.FindById("Adjust");
Command operatorOverride = commands.FindById("OperatorOverride");
Command release = commands.FindById("Release"); 
Console.WriteLine(release);

<br/>

To send the command use the method **`SendCommand`** as showed in the follwing samples:
```csharp
var list1 = new List<object> { 70 };
client.SendCommand(objectId, adjust.CommandId, list1);

var list2 = new List<object> { 75 };
client.SendCommand(objectId, operatorOverride.CommandId, list2);

var list3 = new List<object> { "attributeEnumSet.presentValue", "writePriorityEnumSet.priorityNone" };
client.SendCommand(objectId, release.CommandId, list3);
```
<br/>

#### Get Children
To get the child objects of an object use the method **`GetObjects`**.  
This method requires the identifier (Guid) of the parent object and an optional number of levels to retrieve. 
The default is 1 level or just the immediate children of the object. 
Depending on the number of objects on your server this method can take a very long time to complete.
```csharp
Guid parentId = client.GetObjectIdentifier("WIN-21DJ9JV9QH6:EECMI-NCE25-2/FCB");
// Get direct children (1 level)
List<MetasysObject> directChildren = client.GetObjects(parentId).ToList();
MetasysObject lastChild = directChildren.LastOrDefault();
Console.WriteLine(lastChild);
/*

*/

// Get direct children (1 level) with internal objects
directChildren = client.GetObjects(parentId, includeInternalObjects:true).ToList();  
// Get descendant for 2 levels (it could take long time, depending on the number of objects)
List<MetasysObject> level2Descendants = client.GetObjects(parentId, 2).ToList();
MetasysObject level1Parent = level2Descendants.FindByName("Time");
Console.WriteLine(level1Parent);

## Usage (COM)

This section demonstrates how to use the LegacyMetasysClient to interact with your Metasys server from a VBA application.
Download the Command Line sample project [here](https://github.com/metasys-server/basic-services-dotnet/tree/master/MetasysServicesComExampleApp) and finally the Excel App is available at this [link](https://github.com/metasys-server/basic-services-dotnet/blob/master/MetasysServicesComExampleApp/MetasysApiTest.xlsm).

### Creating a Client
To create a new client and connect to a Metasys server with the default settings use the ComMetasysClientFactory:

```vb
Dim clientFactory As New ComMetasysClientFactory
Dim client As LegacyMetasysClient
Set client = clientFactory.GetLegacyClient("host")
```
There are three optional parameters when creating a new client:

- ignoreCertificateErrors: If your server does not have a valid certificate the LegacyMetasysClient will not behave as expected and will likely block the connection. Setting the ignoreCertificateErrors = true will ignore this error and make an insecure connection with the server. To avoid this problem ensure the Metasys server has a valid certificate.  
  
  **WARNING: You should not ignore certificate errors on a production site. Doing so puts your server at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack.**
  
- apiVersion: your server must run at least Metasys v10.1 or later otherwise this SDK cannot be used. The version parameter takes in an ApiVersion string value that defaults to the most current release of Metasys. For Metasys 10.1 the api version is V2.
- cultureInfo: To set the language for localization specify the target culture with the ISO Language Code string. The default culture is en-US.
- logClientErrors: Set this flag to false to disable logging of client errors. By default the library logs any communication error with the Metasys Server in this path: "C:\ProgramData\Johnson Controls\Metasys Services\Logs".
<cr/>

Example: the following code shows how to create a client that ignores certificate errors for a v12 Metasys server with Italian translations of values:  
```vb
Set client = clientFactory.GetLegacyClient("host", true, "v4", "it-IT")
```
In some cases you may want to enrich logs with more specific messages to your application. Typically, you disable internal library logging and catch Metasys Exceptions to be handled in your own logging framework or Log4Net configuration provided by the library. The file log4Net.config allows you to customize settings such as the file path, size, append mode, etc.
To create a client that does not log errors use:

```vb
Set client = clientFactory.GetLegacyClient("host", true, "v4", "it-IT", false)
```

### Login and Access Tokens
After creating the client, to login use the method **`TryLogin`**.  
this method requires a username and password parameters.  
<cr/>
To login using the Windows Credential Manager use the method **`TryLoginWithCredMan`** 
that requires, as 'target' parameter, the name of the credential defined in Windows.

 **Notice: when developing an application that uses a system account always logged without user input, the preferred way to login is to store the username and password in the Credential Manager vault.**

```vb
Dim token As IComAccessToken
'Login passing username and password
Set token = client.TryLogin("user", "password")

'Login using username/password from Credential Manager vault
Set token = client.TryLogin("vault-target")
```
<br/>

### Metasys Objects

#### Get Object Id
In order to use most of the methods in LegacyMetasysClient the id of the target object must be known. 
To retrieve the identifier of an object use the method **`GetObjectIdentifier`**.  
This method requires the Fully Qualified Reference (FQR) of the object and returns the id as a string (in the form of a Guid).

```vb
Dim id As String
id = client.GetObjectIdentifier("siteName:naeName/Folder1.AV1")
```
<br/>

#### Get a Property
In order to get a property you must know the Guid of the target object and then you can use the method **`ReadProperty`**. 
An object called "ComVariant" is returned when getting a property from an object. 
```vb
Dim result As ComVariant
Set result = client.ReadProperty(id, "presentValue")

Dim stringValue as String
stringValue = result.StringValue

Dim numericValue as Double
numericValue = result.NumericValue

Dim booleanValue as Boolean
booleanValue = result.BooleanValue
```
<br/>

To get multiple properties from multiple objects in one action use the method **`ReadPropertyMultiple`**. 
This can be very useful if the objects all are of the same type or have the same target properties.

```vb
Dim ids() As String
ids = Split("id1,id2", ",")
Dim attributes() As String
ids = Split("name,description", ",")
Dim results() As Object
results = client.ReadPropertyMultiple(ids, attributes)
Dim id1 As IComVariantMultiple
Set id1 = results(0)
Dim variants() As Object
variants=id1.Variants
```
<br/>

#### Write a Property

In order to write a property you must have the Guid of the object and know the attribute name and type
and then you have to use the method **`WriteProperty`**. 

```vb
Dim id As String
id = client.GetObjectIdentifier("siteName:naeName/Folder1.AV1")
client.WriteProperty id, "description", "This is an AV."
```
<br/>

To change the same attribute values of many objects use the method **`WritePropertyMultiple`**. 

```vb
Dim ids() As String
ids = Split("id1,id2", ",")
Dim attributes() As String
attributes = Split("name,description", ",")
Dim attributeValues() As String
attributeValues = Split("AV,This is an AV", ",")
client.WritePropertyMultiple ids, attributes, attributeValues
```
<br/>

#### Get and Send Commands
To get all available commands on an object use the method **`GetCommands`**. 
This method requires the identifier of the object an returns a list of 'ComCommand' objects. 
When sending a command the 'ComCommand.CommandId' attribute is used as parameter.
<br/>

When sending a command there may or may not be a single value or list of values that needs to be sent with the command. 
The Command.Items property will list all of these values as Items which contains the Title and Type of the value to change. If the type of an Item is "oneOf" this indicates the values is an enumeration and the possible values will be contained in the EnumerationValues list. Keep in mind the values to be sent in the command is the TitleEnumerationKey not the Title. 
The Title is the user friendly translated value that describes the enumeration.  
To send the command use the method **`SendCommand`** as showed in the following sample:

```vb
Dim parameters() As String
parameters = Split("offonEnumSet.0,", ",")
client.SendCommand id, "OperatorOverride", parameters
```
<br/>

#### Get Children
To get the child objects of an object use the method **`GetObjects`**.  
This takes the identifier of the parent object and an optional number of levels to retrieve.  
The default is 1 level or just the immediate children of the object.  
Depending on the number of objects on your server this method can take quite a long time to complete.
```vb
Dim devices() As Object
devices = client.GetObjects(id)
Dim device As IComMetasysObject
Set device = devices(0)
Dim children() As Object
children=device.children
```
<br/>



### Network-Devices
<br/>

#### Get Network Device Types
To get all of the available types on your server use the method **`GetNetworkDeviceTypes`** which returns a list of 'ComMetasysObjectType' objects.  

```vb
Dim devTypes() As Object
devTypes = client.GetNetworkDeviceTypes()
```
<br/>

#### Get Network Devices
To get all the available network devices use the method **`GetNetworkDevices`** which returns a list of 'ComMetasysObject' objects.  
This accepts an optional type number as a string to filter the response.  
```vb
Dim devices() As Object
devices = client.GetNetworkDevices()
Dim device As IComMetasysObject
Set device = devices(0)
Dim itemReference as String
itemReference=device.itemReference
```
